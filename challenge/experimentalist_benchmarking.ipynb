        "\n",
        "In this benchmarking challenge, you will be tasked to create an [AutoRA experimentalist](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/experimentalist/) that efficiently samples experiments in order to advance model discovery.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use this notebook to benchmark your experimentalist. Here, we will simulate a discovery experiment in which three different theorists are at work after each data collection cycle. You get to try out your experimentalist for two different ground truth models.\n",

        "## Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to optimize the data collection process in the following workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Sample 10 initial data points\n",
        "2. Fit all theorists to those data points.\n",
        "\n",
        "For 20 data points:\n",
        "3. Pick a single novel data point using your experimentalist method. Your method may or may not take into account any of the theorists' models.\n",
        "4. Add the data point to the experiment data.\n",
        "5. Fit all theorists to the experiment data\n",
        "6. Repeat steps 3-6 until 20 data points were collected\n",
        "\n",
        "This workflow can be repeated two ground-truth models.\n",

        "\n",
        "- All contributing teams must publish a pip package of their experimentalist (we recommend using a pre-release) or have a working git repository that can be installed via ``!pip install git+https://github.com/musslick/autora-experimentalist-example``\n",
        "- The package name must be ``autora-experimentalist-yourexperimentalist``\n",
        "- The **experimentalist must have a sample function (see [this guide](https://autoresearch.github.io/autora/contribute/modules/experimentalist/))**, and it must be **compatible with the state logic** in this notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Teams will be ranked based on the final fit to a ground-truth model. Observations will be sampled across the entire domain of the ground-truth model. The rank will be accumulated across all benchmarking challenges. The team with the best accumulated rank will win a prize at the end of the workshop.\n",
        "- The teams must provide a **brief presentation** (less than 5 minutes) of their experimentalist just before the final evaluation. You may use [this template for your slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qCKqH9uXkQmGqDmROh1Jn4UcauALkMRhqlbAHubns2Q/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

This should be done by simulating closed-loop discovery process with a theorist of your choice (e.g., autora-theorist-bms) on at least two ground-truth models (*Hint: You could use the benchmarking part of the notebook below as a starting point*).\n",

        "  - 2 points: sampling method: which sampling method are you using and why?\n",

        "- 1 point: the contributors used (helpful) code reviews for their PRs.\n",
